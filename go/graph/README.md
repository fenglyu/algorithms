Exercises

17.1 Prove that any acyclic connected graph that has V vertices has V ‚Äì 1 edges.
```
You are given a definition: "an acyclic, connected graph is called a tree."

You are then presented with a claim that this definition is equivalent to "has ùëâ‚àí1 edges and is acyclic" and also equivalent to "has ùëâ‚àí1 edges and is connected." This claim is not proved in the text, and indeed the purpose of the exercise is to prove part of this claim. Thus you may not use the claim when doing the exercise, and must rely on only the initial definition of tree that you were given.

The usual approach is induction on ùëâ. If ùëâ=1, then obviously the claim holds.

Now suppose we have proven the claim for ùëâ=ùëõ. We consider an acyclic connected graph with ùëõ+1 vertices and seek to show it has ùëõ edges. Such a graph must have a leaf (vertex of degree 1). Deleting that vertex and its accompanying edge will produce a graph that is also acyclic and connected. By the inductive hypothesis, this smaller graph has ùëõ‚àí1 edges, so the original graph has ùëõ edges.

Image 17.2 Give all the connected subgraphs of the graph

                           0-1 0-2 0-3 1-3 2-3.

Image 17.3 Write down a list of the nonisomorphic cycles of the graph in Figure 17.1. For example, if your list contains 3-4-5-3, it should not contain 3-5-4-3, 4-5-3-4, 4-3-5-4, 5-3-4-5, or 5-4-3-5.


17.4 Consider the graph

              3-7 1-4 7-8 0-5 5-2 3-8 2-9 0-6 4-9 2-6 6-4.
Determine the number of connected components, give a spanning forest, list all the simple paths with at least three vertices, and list all the nonisomorphic cycles (see Exercise 17.3).


Image 17.5 Consider the graphs defined by the following four sets of edges:

        0-1 0-2 0-3 1-3 1-4 2-5 2-9 3-6 4-7 4-8 5-8 5-9 6-7 6-9 7-8
        0-1 0-2 0-3 0-3 1-4 2-5 2-9 3-6 4-7 4-8 5-8 5-9 6-7 6-9 7-8
        0-1 1-2 1-3 0-3 0-4 2-5 2-9 3-6 4-7 4-8 5-8 5-9 6-7 6-9 7-8
        4-1 7-9 6-2 7-3 5-0 0-2 0-8 1-6 3-9 6-3 2-8 1-5 9-8 4-5 4-7
